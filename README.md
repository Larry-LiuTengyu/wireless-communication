Recognizing the feature of the wireless channel fingerprint based on two algorithms（an application of pattern recognition）

we modeling the feature of the wireless channel "fingerprint", which including the issues like the establishment of the characteristic parameters of " fingerprint ", matching and recognition and "dividing the region" of continuous characteristic parameters. The model solved by the extraction algorithm about wireless channel parameters, BP neural network algorithm and the infinitesimal heuristics proposed by us

针对无线信道“指纹”特征建模，包括“指纹”特征参数的建立、匹配识别、连续特征参数的“区域划分”等问题，用无线信道参数的提取算法、BP神经元网络算法和我们建立的微元试探法对模型进行分析求解
